# Autoclicker-Python
This project is an basic but powerfull autoclicker (it took me ages, absolutely not coded in 5 mins), to use it you need following packages:
>keyboard
>
>pynput

Also cause of the keyboard module you need to run this code as root in linux and as adminisitrator in windows.

Hope you enjoy
